First upload .ino file to your arduino mega and follow the schematic to connect components. you will need 10 potentiometer and 5 button. (notice that the normal arduino don't have enought anolog input, so you need an anolog to digital converter or simply just use mega.)

Second open your max file with .obj (put them in the same folder). You should be able to see all the function in the presentation mode, and it is fine to use without arduino controller.
 
last after setting up the arduino controller, connect controller to your computer and use print in the max file to see your local serial port. change it, and open the serial switch in max. you should control the brain and synth with arduino controller.
